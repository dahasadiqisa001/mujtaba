## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Kivy (`pip install kivy`)
- [Optionally KivyMD for richer UI](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- SQLite3 (included in Python)

### 2. Installation

Clone/download this repo, then:

```bash
pip install kivy
# (Optional, for better UI)
pip install kivymd
```

### 3. Initial Setup

- Add your school logo, splash, and background images to the `assets/` folder.
- Run the database schema script to create the initial SQLite database:

```bash
python db_schema.py
```

### 4. Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

- The app starts with a splash screen, then shows the login page.
- For demo, you may want to add users to the `users` table manually in the SQLite database, or extend the signup logic.

## Security & Production

- **Change default logins and passwords!**
- Hash passwords in production.
- Regularly backup your `school.db`.
- For advanced users: migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL for large schools, integrate SMS/email, or deploy as an APK (Android) or EXE (Windows/Mac).
